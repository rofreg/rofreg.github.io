The small darkness finds its way to me,<br>
nestling into the crook of one arm,<br>
the littlest of spoons.

She comes when called sometimes,<br>
or else when she feels like it,<br>
circling and settling,<br>
filling the vacuum of a body at rest<br>
or the brief yawning spaces<br>
between my wife‚Äôs pillow and mine.<br>
Together we negotiate the gift<br>
of her grey familiar weight,<br>
sprawled and inconvenient<br>
and welcomed all the same.

I know we are lucky, to have arrived<br>
at this mutual understanding‚Äî<br>
that the wild predators of the future<br>
will not all be so willingly tamed.<br>
But this one lays alongside me<br>
for a lingering moment:<br>
both of us asleep and in motion,<br>
tiny hearts racing,<br>
limbs twitching,<br>
half-submerged in void.

May we rest awhile<br>
before we start awake<br>
and resume our common prowl.
