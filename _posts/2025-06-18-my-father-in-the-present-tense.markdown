I think about my father’s eulogy as often as I think about my own,<br>
which is to say: always and never.<br>
<br>
My father is 60, and healthy,<br>
and he stands outside the door of our old Blacksburg apartment,<br>
the one we drove past twice today before<br>
we found ourselves again,<br>
saplings grown tall,<br>
the plain brick mailroom dragging 1990 into now.<br>
He walks me forward-backward from pool to stairwell to balcony,<br>
navigating the memory, his words furnishing<br>
the world I will inherit.<br>
<br>
I have pigeonholed my father before.<br>
I will do it again.<br>
But not when we squint through the plastic blinds together,<br>
outside and inside the smudged glass window,<br>
reconjuring the missing sofa, reinviting absent guests.<br>
We chase our ghosts along footpaths and hallways,<br>
counting stairs, one giant’s step after another,<br>
winding skyward, air thinning at the summit,<br>
old growth in all directions.<br>
The gaps in the guardrails are almost wide enough<br>
for a child to slip through, if no one is watching,<br>
if no one is holding you tight, but<br>
<br>
he will hold my hand until the fever breaks.<br>
He will hold my hand until we are each of us a foreign language,<br>
until we are each of us a dead one,<br>
until every lesson is lost,<br>
until the congregation stops speaking.<br>
<br>
