When I boil you down, cousin,<br>
this is what comes out:<br>
I did not know you.<br>
I do not know what is lost, <br>
only that it is lost,<br>
and that now we are carving the statue<br>
that commemorates the losing.<br>
It will sit in a place of horror<br>
on your mother’s dresser<br>
and in your father’s garage<br>
and by your brother’s bedside,<br>
and when they discard the excess marble,<br>
I will slip a shard into my jacket pocket,<br>
where I will promptly forget about it<br>
until the day it cuts my hand.<br>
<br>
