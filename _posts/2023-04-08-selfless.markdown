That beautiful menace:<br>
the desire for no desire,<br>
the virtue of starvation.<br>
Patron saint of annihilation,<br>
they will use every part<br>
of the animal that is youâ€”<br>
hot and wet and red,<br>
marrow spilling into the soup,<br>
bones into glue,<br>
flowers sprouting from a carcass.<br>
A feast for the senseless.<br>
Your skull above their fireplace.<br>
Go. Bleed out with love.
